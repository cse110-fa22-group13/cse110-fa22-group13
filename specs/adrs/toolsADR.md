# Essential Tools for Developing the Project

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to decide which tools we will use to develop our project. 


## Considered Options

* Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    * Note: No backend, no databases, no NODEJS as individual server
* Storage-> _local storage_ - browser tools cashing
* Version Control: GitHub
* UI Design: Figma
* Communication: Slack
* Planning: Miro
* Application type: CRUD Web App
* Diagramming: With draw.io vscode extension 
* Using local storage
* Electron as packager
    * Decided to not use it, just using local storage instead
* Testing Tool: Jest

* NO FRAMEWORKS ALLOWED --> Packager instead 

## Decision Outcome

* Decisions are made with the priority of the local first system in mind.
* Storage is local
* Developing a desktop app using the given languages. 
* Using Jest as our testing tool
