# CI Choices

## Context and Problem Statement

How we plan to approach our choices for our CI structure and tools.

## Considered Options

* GitHub Actions will be our go-to CI structure
* For unit testing, our tool will be jest
* We have documentation automated for jsDocs
* We are using branch protection
* We have a github action that valides the html and css files within the source directory
* Code review is required (1 other person must approve it)
* For linting, we are using commit lint and using ESLint 
* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome
* We decided on what to use for linting, stated our automation processes, and CI structure.
