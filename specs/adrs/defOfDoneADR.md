# Defining our Definition of Done

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to have a definition of done such that we're not lingering on whether something is done or not. Ideally we should split it into things like "pretty much done", "almost done", "done done" etc. 

## Considered Options
We have the current format for our sprint progess:
* TODO - this is our backlog
* In Progress - this is what we are actively working on
* To Review - these are tasks that are in need of group approval or acknowledgement
* Done - the task is finished
* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Keep the sprint progress as is.
