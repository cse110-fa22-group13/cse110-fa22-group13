## When & Where the meeting was held:  
Start Time: 7:45 pm Place: On Discord

## Intro
- We discussed Malcolm's feedback about our first sprint planning, that overall it was a pretty good way to do it. We are feeling pretty good about how we planned the sprint.

- As a team lead and the facilitator of the meeting, Nick also asked the team members about the current meeting format. Currently, the meetings have been virtually held in a way where Nick shares his screen and leads the meeting by gathering teammates' opinions. Team members agreed with the idea that it is a good method because our attention can be focused on one screen and we can make sure we are on the same page. 

- We all discussed and expressed feelings about how ridiculous this class can be. As the Professor has mentioned, this is kind of two classes in one. We have plenty of work each week with the labs and content of the course, and we have a very large time consuming project, while we have all our other classes to. We all commiserated about that.

## Sharing feelings
- We went through every team member and their feelings about the first sprint.
  - Overall, it was mostly positive, though there is a large amount of stress because of the aforementioned reason, the workload.
  - There were some negative feelings about the lack of progress some teammates made due to a lack of time, which is understandable.
  - Members of subgroups tended to share their sentiments about the first sprint.

- There were some negative feelings that were discussed about a lack of overall communication within a subgroup, and a belief this contributed to a lack of progress

## Conclusion
- We came to the conclusion there should be more direct communication, and we shouldn't solely rely on standups

- Overall, we have found no major issues among teammates and our project and positive feelings about the first sprint and the project process.
