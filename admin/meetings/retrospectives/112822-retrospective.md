## When & Where the meeting was held:  
Start Time: 6:35 pm Place: On Discord

## Intro

- We continued to use a Miro board with sticky notes where we had a space for things that we should start doing, stop doing, and continue doing. 

## Sharing feelings
- Start Doing:
  - Everybody checking and using slack everyday. This was repeated by a few people. We also thought that we should start updating our code progress on slack more regularly. We wanted to also keep the main priorities in mind for this upcoming, last sprint; which is implementing the CRUD stuff with local storage, and finishing the CI/CD stuff. There was another comment about really pushing ourselves for the next sprint so we can make it on time.
  
- Stop Doing:
  - There was a comment that a lot of people need to stop barely checking and using slack. In addition, there was a complaint about the number of slack channels, and that for some members, we need to stop procrastinating. 
  
- Keep Doing:
  - We need to keep working hard like we were able to do for this last sprint. We need to keep putting in work and communicating. Also, we need to continue doing our mob programming as well as continuing to having brief and useful meetings like we did this meeting.

## Conclusion
- There were much better feelings about the previous sprint. It felt like we were able to actually start to get our legs under us. 

- There was an overall feeling that if we really crunch down and persevere, we can push through and get a working project that has quality.
