## When & Where the meeting was held:  
Start Time: 7:00 pm Place: On Discord

## Sprint goal:
- Our goal for the first sprint was to build the fundamental framework of the project by implementing the actual code, organizing the unorganized conventions, and doing research on the validity of Electron JS and Docsify for our project.

## accomplishment
- Set up a github action for HTML/CSS validator
  - On push to the main repository, the github action is activated and checks the syntax of HTML and CSS scripts.
- Implemented the homepage (index.html and index.css)
  - did not close the task issue because it still needs to be updated with connecting to other web pages.
- Updated ReadMe to reflect the current changes to the project
- Successfully set up a Electron app and JSDocs in a testing environment
  - research on Electron JS and its alternatives, Cordova and Tauri, turned out that Tauri would be the best choice in the perfect environment. However, due to the possibility of having more time commitment to adapt to Tauri system, Electron JS is better option.
  - Could not find better reason to use Cordova.
  - Electron JS is determined to be the current best option.
  - Research on documentation tool suggested that JSDocs might be more useful in terms of time commitment than Docsify (our previous choice).
## Feedback
- Closed some smaller task issues after reviewing them.
- The implemented homepage looks good to start connecting to other pages
- Did some overall code clean up and trimmed unused and merged branches
- Confirmed our decision to use Electron JS
- Decided to change the choice of documentation tool from Doscify to JSDocs
- Discussed progress on linter
## Backlog
- Items needed to be continued and improved from the first sprint are pushed into backlog of the sprint 2.
- Created some tasks related to Javascript for the second sprint
- Created some documentation update tasks based on the accomplishment of the first sprint as well as the upcoming assignments' checkpoint

**When the meeting finished:** 7:45pm
