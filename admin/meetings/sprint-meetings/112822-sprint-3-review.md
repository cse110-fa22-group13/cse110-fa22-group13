## When & Where the meeting was held:  
Start Time: 6:00PM Place: On Discord

## Sprint goal:
- Since it was one week before the final product release week, our sprint goal was to accomplish the CRUD features as much as possible.

## accomplishment
- New high fidelity figma
  - With the new high fidelity figma, we can see the details of how the final product should look like.
- Update the labels
  - Deleted unnecessary labels and added new labels that provide more detailed information about a labeled task.
- Book entries page with responsive feature
  - Implemented the responsive feature in the current book entries webpage so that the webpage can be accessible from any size of devices.
- Changes from the previous book entries object to custom web component
  - As we understood the need to change the way of book entries implementation, we have developed the new structure for the new book entries object web component.
- Progress on CRUD features
  - 60% of the CRUD features is done including several working buttons for create and delete.
## Feedback
- We discussed the priority of our tasks: 
  1. get all CRUD features done
  2. get CI/CD done
- According to our discussed priority, we need to have Linter done
- As we are slightly behind the other teams, we need to buckle down and push ourselves a bit more so that we can finish everything on time.
- As we have two prioritized tasks, we need to be more focused on implementing those tasks, rather than other tasks that can be implemented after the prioritized tasks.


## Backlog
- Most of the unfinished items from the previous sprint will be pushed into backlog for the next sprint as they are essential tasks.
- Update the existing documents according to the new changes
- solve merge conflict with CRUD branch and main branch
- deployment to Github actions
- update unit testing for Book entry object due to changes to object
- The details can be found on [issues](https://github.com/cse110-fa22-group13/cse110-fa22-group13/issues)
