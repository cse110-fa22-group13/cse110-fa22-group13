# The Jsons (Team 13)

Description of project: We plan to create MyBookList.
We seek to create a powerful, efficient, and utility-based book review and progress aggregator and tracker that will help book lovers and aficionados chart, guide, and track the activity they love and enjoy so much.     

Using the basic languages of the web, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as collaboration and agility; we will build a local-first CRUD progressive web application.    

We will create this application to serve Book lovers, burgeoning readers, and literary critics who want to always own their own book reviews and progress reports, and be able to track and access reviews regardless of location or web connection.
